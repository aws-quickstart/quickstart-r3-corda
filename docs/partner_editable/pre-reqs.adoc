==== Prepare for the deployment

This Quick Start will create a deployment of a single logical Corda node. This Corda node will need to connect to a Corda network of other Corda nodes in order to transact. By default, the template is configured for connection to the Corda Testnet. To provision your AWS based node to this Testnet, you will need a ONE-TIME KEY, which you can obtain by signing up for the Corda Testnet at http://testnet.corda.network/ and creating a node (the key is valid for one hour). After you have obtained the key, paste it into the *One-time key* parameter field in the template. Your node will automatically provision and connect to Testnet when you run the template.
